This project solves udacity unity environement using ddpg algorithm

Project Dependencies:
1.pytorch
2.numpy
3.unityagents (install using pip)

Environment Discription:

A double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

For this Environment, we are provided  with two separate versions of the Unity environment:
- The first version contains a single agent.
- The second version contains 20 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.


The barrier for solving the second version of the environment is slightly different, to take into account the presence of many agents.  In particular, agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents).  Specifically,

- After each episode, we need to add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent.  This yields 20 (potentially different) scores.  We then take the average of these 20 scores. 
- This yields an **average score** for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those average scores is at least +30.
